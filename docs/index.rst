GetControl
##########

**GetControl** software is designed to help with managing structural refinements (mainly using the powder diffraction data) performed using `FullProf Suite`_ software.

It can help to visualise all PCR files in the directory, collect and aggregate the information from various files created during the structural refinement and visualise them. Furthermore, it facilitates easy access to the supplementary files with further analysis.

I developed it to help me get a quicker overview and control over a vast number of additional info you can obtain from the refinement. Of course, the way it works is not suitable for all, but someone can find it helpful.

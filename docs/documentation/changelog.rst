All suggestions are welcomed at prema@email.cz

Version 0.9
^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 0.9.1 build 1
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: 01/04/2025

- After the FP update to v8.2, the file name structure changed. Now, GC should read old and new file names correctly.

Version 0.9.0 build 1
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: 14/02/2025

- All the non-FP icons remade for better contrast
- Lots of internal process and layout updates
- In the FP tools buttons, added the button to launch the FP toolbar
- The button for launching the terminal was added to the toolbar
- When opening the directory, the files starting with "._" are filtered out now
- Autocompletion function to insert additional code lines in the internal editor added (Ctrl+Space)

Version 0.8
^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 0.8.0 build 2
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: 20/03/2024

- The old PCR format created out of the DICVOL program was not read properly; now corrected (thanks, Stefan, for reporting)
- Creating "cryscalc" input file via CC was not working when there were no atoms in the phase; not corrected
- Some minor adjustments to the layout
- First draft of documentation published on `<https://wildrams.github.io/getcontrol/>`__ (link added in the About form)

Version 0.8.0 build 1
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: 28/02/2024

- Updated the Python scripts (SXY and MIC plotter) to use UTF8 charset
- Not possible to change the axes title is corrected
- Corrected the wrong formatting of the edited hints file
- Some improvements of the FP hints strings
- Corrected wrong reading of the atomic parameters when using atomic types with negative signs
  (ex. O-2); thanks, Stefan, for reporting
- Changed the colours for the MIC tab for better visibility; it is possible to reset the marks' colour
- The font of the FP hints is set to one with the fixed pitch for better formatting
- Added an extraction of the negative FWHM points from '*'.out file; the list of points is shown
  at the "Refinement summary" tab at the end (folding is available)
- Added the site fraction (0-1 notation) for each atom (suggested by Stefan); useful when not the full site
  or mixed-site occupancy
- Double-click on the `*`.PCR file in the list opens the PCR file in an editor (suggested by Vitalii)
- When you provide the number of formula units on the line with the phase title, GC can calculate the composition
  based on the chemical formula, not by the unit cell; put "Z=x" where x is your formula unit number; this will not
  affect the FP refinement or VARY and FIX commands; for example: My new phase Z=4 VARY xyz FIX b; note capital Z
- A link to the license was added to the About form

Version 0.7
^^^^^^^^^^^

  icons (normal/medium/large) and also the font size for all hints (useful for long FP hints in high-DPI).

Version 0.7.2 build 1
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: 24/07/2023

- New bottom toolbar was added to access the "cryscalc" tool (CC). First, you create a `*`_cc_`*`.cfl file, which can
  be edited, and then you launch it, and the result file (`*`.cci) is automatically opened. Some more hits for
  cryscalc are shown. The file can be modified as necessary. Cryscalc can be launched directly from
  the internal editor when `*`_cc_`*`.cfl file is active.

  should show all patterns even if some phases don't contribute.
- some update in the summary info when magnetic phases are used
- the project was moved to Github as there will be disruption of the old server for external users
- update the Linux and Windows updater to version 0.3.1.1

  the other patterns were not affected; this error is now corrected (thanks, Johan, for reporting)
- update of the editor FP hints
- for Jbt=10 the magnetic and nuclear R-factors are read from `*`.out file instead of `*`.sum
- when Dysnomia is created, the additional `*`.vesta file combining both the density map and
  CIF file is created, accessible through the Dysnomia menu (Density map with structure)
- microstructure information is read from the `*`.mic file written in the Profile tab
- if the microstructure model is used, the Williamson-Hall plot is shown in the new tab,
  some more info and adjustments can be made on the new tab; the tab is visible only when there is
  none-zero microstructure

  is run automatically after.
- Editor - status of the parameter 'Aut' is shown and can be switched on and of by the button. Switching it off 
  doesn't mean directly not refine any parameter. It is useful when after the dummy cycle, you want to switch 
  the refinement back on.
- Editor - removal of the old Chi2 value stored in PCR and used to check if the refinement is better than 
  the last one. It can create unnecessary warnings, which can be overcome by deleting the old value.

  your config directory to see the new one; if you have made some serious update of the hints and you want to share it
  then drop me an email (thanks)

- save PRF pattern also like images of different formats
- debug log disabled by default - you can delete all the log file in the config directory 
  (in Win7 or Vista $YourProfilePath$\AppData\Local\GetControl\ in Linux /home/user_name/.config/GetControl)
- new icons in the main form added
- Linux version released and the update procedure changed to accommodate also Linux updater

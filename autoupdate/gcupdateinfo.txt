 Tool for collecting information about 
 structural refinements using FullProf

 Web page on Github https://github.com/WildRams/getcontrol
 Documentation on https://wildrams.github.io/getcontrol/
 
 Compiled with CT 8.5
 
- all suggestions are welcomed at prema@email.cz
-----------------------------------------------
21/07/2025 0.9.2 build 1
- Added toggle button on the main and editor form to be able to switch between those forms (shortcut F12).
  It is useful when working in fullscreen mode. The editor form doesn't need to be closed when you launch FP.
- Extraction (or calculation when only PCR available) of the unit cell volume added. Value listed below cell parameters.
- Single-crystal PCR can be read, but reading of the PRF file is not yet implemented.
-----------------------------------------------
25/04/2025 0.9.1 build 2
- After the last update and change of FP file names, the *.sub files were not loaded, now corrected
- Opening of *.mic files via the submenu in the bottom toolbar was not working when using FP version < 8.2
-----------------------------------------------
13/02/2025 0.9.1 build 1
- After the FP update to v8.2, the file name structure changed. Now, GC should read old and
  new file names correctly.
-----------------------------------------------
13/02/2025 0.9.0 build 1
- All the non-FP icons remade for better contrast
- Lots of internal process and layout updates
- In the FP tools buttons, added the button to launch the FP toolbar
- The button for launching the terminal was added to the toolbar
- When opening the directory, the files starting with "._" are filtered out now

-----------------------------------------------
20/03/2024 0.8.0 build 2

- First draft of documentation published on https://wildrams.github.io/getcontrol/ (link added in the About form)
-----------------------------------------------
28/02/2024 0.8.0 build 1

  (ex. O-2)Thanks, Stefan, for reporting
- Changed the colours for the MIC tab for better visibility; it is possible to reset the marks' colour
- The font of the FP hints is set to one with the fixed pitch for better formatting
- Added an extraction of the negative FWHM points from *.out file; the list of points is shown
  at the "Refinement summary" tab at the end (folding is available)
- Added the site fraction (0-1 notation) for each atom (suggested by Stefan); useful when not the full site
  or mixed-site occupancy
- Double-click on the *.PCR file in the list opens the PCR file in an editor (suggested by Vitalii)
- When you provide the number of formula units on the line with the phase title, GC can calculate the composition
  based on the chemical formula, not by the unit cell; put "Z=x" where x is your formula unit number; this will not
  affect the FP refinement or VARY and FIX commands; for example: My new phase Z=4 VARY xyz FIX b; note capital Z
- A link to the license was added to the About form
-----------------------------------------------

  cryscalc are shown. The file can be modified as necessary. Cryscalc can be launched directly from
  the internal editor when *_cc_*.cfl file is active.

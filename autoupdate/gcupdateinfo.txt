-----------------------------------------------
28/02/2024 0.8.0 build 1
 - Updated the Python scripts (SXY and MIC plotter) to use UTF8 charset
 - Not possible to change the axes title is corrected
 - Corrected the wrong formatting of the edited hints file
 - Some improvements of the FP hints strings
 - Corrected wrong reading of the atomic parameters when using atomic types with negative signs
   (ex. O-2)Thanks, Stefan, for reporting
 - Changed the colours for the MIC tab for better visibility; it is possible to reset the marks' colour
  - The font of the FP hints is set to one with the fixed pitch for better formatting
 - Added an extraction of the negative FWHM points from *.out file; the list of points is shown
   at the "Refinement summary" tab at the end (folding is available)
 - Added the site fraction (0-1 notation) for each atom (suggested by Stefan); useful when not the full site
   or mixed-site occupancy
 - Double-click on the *.PCR file in the list opens the PCR file in an editor (suggested by Vitalii)
 - When you provide the number of formula units on the line with the phase title, GC can calculate the composition
   based on the chemical formula, not by the unit cell; put "Z=x" where x is your formula unit number; this will not
   affect the FP refinement or VARY and FIX commands; for example: My new phase Z=4 VARY xyz FIX b; note capital Z
